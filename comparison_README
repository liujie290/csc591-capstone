Description:
Imports the specified data based on the given starting and ending congress session number.
Runs the FastGreedy, Walktrap, and Leading Eigenvector community detection algorithms
on the specified data and compares the resulting modularities between the different algorithms.

Usage:
python comparison.py <house|senate> <starting_congress_session_number> <ending_congress_session_number>

Valid Congress Session Numbers:
1 - 113 (I used Senate sessions 100 - 113 to complement the results obtained by cluster_igraph.py)

Check for output in:
Leading Eigenvector Senate Clusters folder: the clusters produced by the Leading Eigenvector
algorithm on Senate sessions 100 - 113

Walktrap Senate Clusters folder: the clusters produced by the Walktrap algorithm on Senate sessions 100 - 113

(FastGreedy graph results already produced by cluster_igraph.py)

comparison.png - A plot of the modularities produced for each outputed graph by the different algorithms. 

This program also prints the number of communities and the modularity scores
obtained by the different algorithms to the console.
